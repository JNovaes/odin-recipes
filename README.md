# odin-recipes
This is an assignment as part of The Odin Project. 
The task is to create a very basic recipe website in order to practise html.

Skills I hope to practice are: 

    Cloning a GitHub repository to my local machine.
    Committing changes to git with good messages and pushing to GitHub.
    Creating multiple pages with html including links, images and lists.
    Maintaining good file structure.
